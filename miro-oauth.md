This guide explains how to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow for Miro. By following these steps, you can obtain an access token and interact with Miroâ€™s REST API on behalf of a user. You will learn how to:

1. Prompt users to install your app in Miro.
2. Exchange an authorization code for an access token.
3. Use the access token in REST API calls.
4. Request a new access token with a refresh token.

## Goal [Skip link to Goal](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth#goal)

Acquire an OAuth 2.0 access token that allows you to make REST API calls to Miro on behalf of a user.

## Prerequisites [Skip link to Prerequisites](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth#prerequisites)

Before you begin, ensure that you have:

- [Created a Developer team](https://developers.miro.com/docs/create-a-developer-team).
- [Created your app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rest-api-build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-1-create-your-app-in-miro).
- [Configured your app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rest-api-build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-2-configure-your-app-in-miro).
- [Installed your app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/rest-api-build-your-first-hello-world-app#step-3-install-the-app).

> ## ðŸš§ Client ID and client secret
>
> Be sure to note your **client ID** and **client secret**. Youâ€™ll need both values when exchanging codes for tokens and when requesting refresh tokens.

## Step 1: Prompt users to install your app [Skip link to Step 1: Prompt users to install your app](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth#step-1-prompt-users-to-install-your-app)

The OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow begins with prompting a user to install and authorize your app in Miro. This step is where the user grants your app permission to interact with their Miro content.

> ## ðŸ“˜ Tip
>
> For details about the specific permissions you can request, see the [Scopes reference](https://miro-ea.readme.io/reference/scopes).

1. Create an authorization request link. Youâ€™ll need the following parameters to build the link:

   - **Miro authorization base URL**: `https://miro.com/oauth/authorize`
   - **response_type**: `code`
   - **client_id**: Your appâ€™s client ID
   - **redirect_uri**: A redirect URI that you configure in your [App Settings](https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps)

**Example request link**:

Shell

```rdmd-code lang-sh theme-light

https://miro.com/oauth/authorize
    ?response_type=code
    &client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}
    &redirect_uri={YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}

```

Make sure that your `redirect_uri` can handle both successful and unsuccessful authorization attempts.

2. Direct the user to this link. In your application, you might have a **Sign in to Miro** or **Sync to Miro** button. When the user clicks this button, redirect them to the authorization link. The user is then prompted to:

   - Sign in with Miro credentials.
   - Review the permissions your app is requesting.
   - Approve or reject the request.

> ## ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> If you are using the Miro logo in your app or integration, ensure your usage complies with the [Miro branding guidelines](https://brandkit.miro.com/corporate-visual-identity/introduction).

## Step 2: Exchange authorization code for an access token [Skip link to Step 2: Exchange authorization code for an access token](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth#step-2-exchange-authorization-code-for-an-access-token)

After the user installs and authorizes your application, Miro returns an **authorization code**. This authorization code **cannot** be used for API calls directly; you must exchange it for an **access token**.

> ## ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> Some authentication endpoints have `v1` in the URL; these endpoints are not deprecated.

To exchange the authorization code for an access token, make an HTTP POST request to Miroâ€™s token endpoint. Include:

- **client_id** (required)
- **client_secret** (required)
- **code** (the authorization code you received)
- **redirect_uri** (must match your app settings)
- **grant_type**: `authorization_code`

**Example cURL**:

Bash

```rdmd-code lang-bash theme-light

curl --request POST
    --url '<https://api.miro.com/v1/oauth/token>
        ?grant_type=authorization_code
        &client_id={CLIENT_ID}
        &client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}
        &code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}
        &redirect_uri={REDIRECT_URI}'

```

**Example response**:

JSON

```rdmd-code lang-json theme-light

{
    "user_id": "9876543210123456789",
    "refresh_token": "eyJtaXJvLm9yaWdpbiI6ImV1MDEifQ_-PIBKmE9rzQuL3bUeAvUEGFEhLk",
    "access_token": "eyJtaXJvLm9yaWdpbiI6ImV1MDEifQ_o-P91OccaII0A63CDSK--x21xiI",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "team_id": "1234567890987654321",
    "scope": "boards:write boards:read",
    "token_type": "bearer"
}

```

You are responsible for storing and securing this token data. A common practice is to store these tokens in a database, linked to your usersâ€™ Miro information.

## Step 3: Use the access token for REST API requests [Skip link to Step 3: Use the access token for REST API requests](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth#step-3-use-the-access-token-for-rest-api-requests)

With a valid access token, you can make REST API calls on behalf of the user.

- Include the access token in the `Authorization` header.
- Use the format `Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}`.

**Example cURL**:

Bash

```rdmd-code lang-bash theme-light

curl --request GET
    --url <https://api.miro.com/v2/boards/{BOARD_ID}>
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'

```

## Step 4: Request a new access token using a refresh token [Skip link to Step 4: Request a new access token using a refresh token](https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-oauth#step-4-request-a-new-access-token-using-a-refresh-token)

Miro recommends using expiring access tokens. By default, an access token is valid for 60 minutes and includes a **refresh token** that remains valid for 60 days. If the access token expires or is compromised, you can use the refresh token to request a new access token.

When you request a new access token using a refresh token, the response includes:

- A **new access token**
- A **new refresh token** (resetting the validity period for 60 days)

To request a new token with the refresh token, make an HTTP `POST` request to the same Miro token endpoint. This time, set **grant_type** to `refresh_token` and include your current refresh token. You do not need to include the `redirect_uri`.

**Example cURL**:

Bash

```rdmd-code lang-bash theme-light

curl --request POST
    --url '<https://api.miro.com/v1/oauth/token>
        ?grant_type=refresh_token
        &client_id={CLIENT_ID}
        &client_secret={CLIENT_SECRET}
        &refresh_token={REFRESH_TOKEN}'

```
